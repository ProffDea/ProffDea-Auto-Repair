# ProffDea-Auto-Repair
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly mod to pair with the [Auto Looter](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/itheons-auto-looter-v014) mod packed in G.A.M.M.A.

This mod's only function is to repair the multitool when at 79% and below with sharpening stones when disassembling to
feed my loot goblin tendencies. This is the only feature implemented for the time being.

### Plans
- Auto repair knife, armor, and guns
- Mod Configuration Menu
  - Toggles on what should be auto repaired (Guns, armor, etc.)
  - Toggles on if repair item should be used automatically (Basic Sewing Kit, etc.)
  - Guns, and armor are disabled by default

### Why guns & armor disabled by default?
Auto repairing guns and armor has an effect on gameplay such as constantly having max resistence as long as the
corresponding items are in the inventory thus they will be disabled by default in MCM. (If I manage to implement the
feature in the first place)

### Thank you
For checking this out. If this mods looks incomplete, that's because it is. This being my first mod for any game ever is a
contributing factor.
